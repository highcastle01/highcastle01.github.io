NVIDIA has made over 100% in profits this year. But why is it bound to rise even further?

<!--more-->

NVIDIA's Q2 earnings were incredibly strong, contrary to the market's expectations.  
Personally, I was puzzled by the drop in its stock price (unfortunately, I was caught in it).  
The market had very high expectations, and at the time, the Fed hadn't yet decided on a rate cut.  
Concerns about a recession were also very high, so the outcome was somewhat understandable.

So, why is NVIDIA bound to rise?

First, the "winter" for the semiconductor market hasn't arrived yet.  
Reports like Goldman Sachs' "Winter is Coming" might be out, but Micron's earnings came in very strong.  
Semiconductor companies always show solid results, and NVIDIA is no exception.  
Even if growth slows, the Q3 earnings estimates have risen significantly compared to before.

Second, the U.S. economy is incredibly strong.  
Recently released U.S. GDP growth rates and various unemployment indicators strongly prove that the U.S. is not entering a recession (hopefully).

Third, data centers have yet to be fully installed.  
Along with Super Micro Computer, NVIDIA's massive moneymaker, the data center industry, still has many installations pending.  
The extremely expensive A100, H100... and now the upcoming Blackwell cards...  
There are still tens, hundreds, or even thousands of data centers that need to install these kinds of graphics cards.

I hope the stock price goes up.
