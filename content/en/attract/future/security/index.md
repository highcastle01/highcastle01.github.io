What about working at a security company? But is it too late?

### Why a Security Company? ###
I haven't really studied security intensively yet, but I've been learning little by little.  
As I go along, I realized that while there are specialized security companies, security is a field that most companies need.  
This means there could be quite a few opportunities.

### Where Should I Go? ###
Going to a major corporation would be great, but I also want to gain hands-on experience in the field.  
This is because I believe that the experience will compensate for any shortcomings I might have in terms of intelligence.  
I want to work from small and medium-sized enterprises to public institutions, gradually building my skills from the ground up.

### What Do I Need? ###
Relevant security certifications, knowledge, and experience are essential.

### When Do I Want to Go? ###
I always want to start as soon as possible.
