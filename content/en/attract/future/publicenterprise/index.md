For someone like me, who values a stable life above all else, public corporations offer the best advantages.

### Why a Public Corporation? ###
Some people are undoubtedly challenge-driven, but I prioritize stability more than anything.  
Public corporations allow me to build achievements, grow, and secure a stable future, which is why I aspire to work there.

### Where Should I Go? ###
There are countless public corporations: LX, LH, Korea Gas Corporation, KEPCO, KEPCO KPS...  
Among them, Iâ€™m most interested in public corporations related to land or space, as well as financial public corporations like the Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation and the Korea Exchange.

### What Do I Need? ###
The most important things are the ability to pass the NCS (National Competency Standards) and the skills to succeed in coding tests.

### When Do I Want to Go? ###
As soon as possible. Of course, I need to graduate first, so going right after finishing my senior year seems like the best option.
