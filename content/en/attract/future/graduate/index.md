### Why Graduate School? ###
I've heard a lot about graduate school through a friend majoring in physics, where it's almost a necessity.

During my time as an undergraduate researcher, I’ve often heard discussions about graduate school.  
People often say that going to graduate school will definitely enhance my qualifications and help in the future.

### Where Should I Go? ###
Top-tier domestic graduate schools like Seoul National University, KAIST, and POSTECH reportedly require not only excellent grades but also strong performance in their own tests.  
Given my current level, it might be challenging.

### What Do I Need? ###
If I want to go to graduate school, the most important thing is to improve my grades and elevate my current level.  
It’s not only about improving after getting in but becoming the kind of candidate that fits the graduate school before applying.

### Will I Go to Graduate School? ###
I'm still a junior, and taking a break is always an option.  
If this is the right path for me and what I want to pursue for my livelihood, I will carefully consider and make the decision.
