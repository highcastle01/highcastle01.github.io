This summer, I participated in the TREC 2024 Product Search.

This summer, our Information Mining Lab took part in the TREC 2024 Product Search.  
At first, many things were unfamiliar, and there were many parts I didn't understand.

Since I had only used Python for solving algorithm problems or web scraping, my unfamiliarity with other aspects became a significant weakness.

However, through reading papers and learning various codes during the process,  
by the end of the competition, I could feel myself growing.
