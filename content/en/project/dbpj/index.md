## Database Team Project: Store Recommendation Service Around Chonbuk National University ##

### Where to Meet? How to Spend Free Time? ###

For our database team project, we developed a store recommendation service around Chonbuk National University, helping users find places to visit when they need to meet or have free time.  
Users select the purpose for using the service, and based on this, the service retrieves and displays relevant data stored in the database.

### Frontend ###

The frontend was developed using NEXT.js.

### Backend ###

We used Nest.js and MySQL for the backend.

### Recommendation Service ###

The recommendation service does not use advanced tools like LLM. Instead, it is powered by simple SQL queries and conditionals.
