## Capstone ##

### AI-Based Emotion Diary ###

For any student majoring in Computer and Artificial Intelligence at Chonbuk National University, Capstone is a necessary milestone before graduation.  
I had the opportunity to take this Capstone project in my third year instead of the usual fourth year, which led to a lot of contemplation.

### Data Preprocessing ###

We crawled and processed posts from various internet communities, as well as pre-processed refined data provided by AI Hub.

### Frontend ###

To develop the app, we used React Native for cross-platform development.

### Backend ###

To handle middleware and various modules efficiently, we utilized Nest.js, with PostgreSQL as the database.

### LLM ###

We used the Kobert model for emotion classification and Llama3 to generate and provide messages.
