## Introduction

Hello, I am Yimseonghyuk, a junior student majoring in Computer and Artificial Intelligence at Chonbuk National University. This page contains a brief overview of my education, contact information, and the projects I have worked on.
I am interested in various fields related to computer science, particularly artificial intelligence and security.
To pursue these interests, I am actively participating as an undergraduate researcher in the Information Mining Lab and have been involved in various activities, including winning awards in internal security competitions.
As this is my introduction page, I hope you can learn a lot about me.
Please feel free to contact me if needed. Thank you.
